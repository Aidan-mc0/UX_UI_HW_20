            <h2>GOAL</h2>
            <p>When choosing an NPO website to create a responsive web design for, our team looked for a website that had issues when displaying on different screens and additionally one that needed a visual update. The goal was to not only provide a visual overhaul but also improve the user experience for their supporters.</p>

                <h2>Stakeholder Interview</h2>
                <p>In order to understand how to best start with our redesign we had a meeting with two employees from NCC. The team got powerful insights that we were able to draw from discussing their strategic plan until 2030 and their reasons behind them being in the process of their own redesign of their website. A lot of the issues surrounding the site were concerning the lack of responsive web design & a web design that is over 10 years old not allowing for a positive user experience. In order to meet their strategic goals, a requirement for NCC is to redesign their website.</p>

                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>We conducted 5 user interviews to gauge how a user might navigate the old design of the NCC website. A lot of the insights gathered by NCC themselves, were echoed through user interviews.

                    Especially on mobile, image resolutions were poor, navigation wasn't function properly, some text was too small, mobile screens were not optimized, and users found the donation process to be another issue.</p>

            <p>To increase monthly donations and attract new demographics, the Nature Conservancy Canada's website needs a user-centred & responsive design. By improving website usability and creating a seamless user journey, the organization can provide a positive donation experience for users. How might we improve the usability of the website so that it generates an increase in new monthly donors?</p>

        <div class="information">
            <p>
                Through our user research, and user testing of our prototype, we were able to make iterations to the UI and improve the overall user experience. The problem we highlighted in our problem statement was that the current design is not responsive or user-centered. Even if the majority of funding for NCC comes from philanthropic donation and government funding, We still believed that by having an improved donation method, it would help support their strategic goals.

                Mobile users are about a 50/50 split for traffic to the NCC website, so targeting them while also providing a better experience to every visitor to their sight is going to be instrumental in reaching their goals for funding and growing their supporter base by 2030.

                With input from the users we tested, and through thorough research, the team was able to transform a website that was designed before 2010 and was not responsive or user friendly into a sleek, modern site with improved navigation, smoother donation process, and overall better user experience.
