        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Every good design solution relies on a strong foundation of good research. The research helps frame exactly what problem I need to solve. The insights I gather from my user research helps to inform my decisions every step of the way during my design process. In order to solve a problem you first have to understand exactly what it is that a user wants and then I can address those problems.</p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>If the interface is the way users interact with your website or mobile app, then it is increasingly important for me as a UI designer to design intuitive and engaging user interfaces. By extension, that means within the user interface, I always aim to  craft a memorable user experience that positively represents the clients I design for.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>It's one thing to talk, but is it really impressive if you can put your money where your mouth is? Coding isn't for everyone, however having CSS/HTML/JavaScript knowledge ensures freedom in my design process. Front-end development is what brings each project from just a good idea or a problem you want to solve to reality; a design that solves problems.</p>
